## :credit_card: Classifying credit applicants [[Presentation]](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Credit-applicant-classification/blob/main/Presentation.pdf)[[Report]](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/Credit-applicant-classification/blob/main/Report.pdf)

The goal of this study is to determine, in an automated manner, whether new applicants present good or
bad credit risk. Several machine learning models are trained to classify applicants based on their credit
rating. A random forest is found to be the best performing model, which ascertains the checking account
status, credit duration, credit history, average balance in savings account, and credit amount, to be the
most decisive information for classification.

Tested ML models:
* Logistic regression
* Neural networks
* Decision trees
* Random forest
* LDA
* KNN
* SVM
* Naive-Bayes
* Combination
